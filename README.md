# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs can be interpreted through asking end users about their expectations, needs, wants, and preferences to utiliziing a product. Implementing user needs starts with understanding what a user is asking for and then adding that to the product backlog. Creating user stories helps explain how the product will meet the needs of the end users.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Currently I already develop functions in short sprints, but I didn't know that it was an actual developmental process. I hope to be able to further incorporate agile practices in the future by implementing planning excercises and practicing in creating a product backlog. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development takes team meetings seriously, is able to communicate whenever there are impediments or if a particular function is taking longer than expected or if there is confusion about an aspect of the project, and they are able to take feedback from others on the team.
